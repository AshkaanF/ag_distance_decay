## Distance-Decay Patterns
#### Ashkaan K Fahimipour

This repository contains scripts that recreate distance-decay analyses from data retrieved from the AG FTP server. Since files are too large for Github, to run simply:

1. download this repository
2. place gunzipped bray-curtis and unifrac files into the `data` subdirectory 
3. change the working directories to yours on the first lines of both `dist_decay_bray.R` and `dist_decay_unifrac.R`.

Figures generated by these scripts can be found in `figs`. Each script takes _c.a._ 1.5 hours to run on 4 cores.
