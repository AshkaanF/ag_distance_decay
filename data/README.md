## data

This subdirectory needs to contain three pieces of data. Since files are too large for Github, to run simply:

1. Place gunzipped bray-curtis and unifrac files into the `data` subdirectory. These should be named `bray_curtis.txt` and `weighted-normalized.txt` (the default file names from the FTP server).
2. Use the enclosed mapping file `map.txt`, which was generated by simply deleting the leading `#` symbol from the column headers (for compatibility with R's `read.csv` function).
